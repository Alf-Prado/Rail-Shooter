# StarWolf Game
Consists in a space based game, where the player constantly moves forward while avoiding and/or shooting different objects such as inmobile mines, and space debris, but also following enemies. The movement mechanics is based on the game: Starfox.
* Single and Multiplayer mode through UNet Networking (The same level is used in both modes but object instancing number is reduced in Multiplayer for better performance).

 * A Cinemachine Dolly Cart is implemented to keep a constant forward movement, limiting X and Y with the camera view

- Instancing for different objects within an specified area, where every object type is assigned:
  - A random size in a range of values.
  - A different damage if the player collides.
  - Five levels of detail, reducing the polygon count for each object depending on the distance to the player.

- The following enemy guides itself to the player with a Finite State Machine:
  - A Mesh Filter is positioned in the level, checking on each Update the player's position, assigning an approximate value to the texture, so the enemy can find the player.
  - The player's position in the mesh can be seen with a Mesh Filter texture color, but it's disabled so as not to interfere with sight.

- The Mines that automatically end the game when the player collides with them are Tessellated octahedrons.
  - The octahedron is modeled inside the script with vertex, faces and connections.
  - It is tessellated 4 times, so it has the appearance of a sphere.
  - 5 spikes are randomly generated for each sphere with normalized vectors.

- A rear view that shows when the player hits "3". It's a Render Texture that's positioned behind the player. When it's activated, the ship will also shoot backwards.
